    "- **Traditional Chat Completions:** Facilitates seamless conversational AI experiences.\n",
    "- **Web Search:** Enables real-time information retrieval from the internet.\n",
    "- **File Search:** Allows searching within files for relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, the Assistants API will be retired in 2026. \n",

       "1. **OpenAI’s GPT‑5.1 Release**  \n",
       "   - On **November 12, 2025**, OpenAI released **GPT‑5.1**, a refined version of its GPT‑5 foundation model ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-5.1?utm_source=openai)).  \n",
       "   - GPT‑5.1 introduces enhancements such as reduced hallucinations, improved instruction following, faster performance, and a more “warm” default personality. It includes two operational modes: **Instant**, for quick responses, and **Thinking**, optimized for complex reasoning tasks ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-5.1?utm_source=openai)).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Brain‑Inspired \"Dragon Hatchling\" Architecture by Pathway**  \n",
       "   - Researchers unveiled a novel architecture termed **Dragon Hatchling**, designed to mimic the dynamic neural structures of the human brain. Unlike traditional transformer-based LLMs, this model continuously adapts its internal structure in real time—forming and adjusting pathways akin to neuroplasticity.  \n",
       "   - Early tests showed performance comparable to GPT‑2, signaling promise for models that can learn and generalize over time without full retraining ([livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/new-dragon-hatchling-ai-architecture-modeled-after-the-human-brain-could-be-a-key-step-toward-agi-researchers-claim?utm_source=openai)).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **World Generation via Spatial AI by World Labs**  \n",
       "   - **World Labs**, co-founded by Fei‑Fei Li, introduced **Marble**, a generative AI tool for creating 3D worlds from text, image, or video prompts. Launched in November 2025, Marble integrates with Unity and Unreal Engine, offering creators a streamlined environment-creation workflow ([theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/820016/world-labs-is-betting-on-world-generation-as-the-next-ai-frontier?utm_source=openai)).  \n",

       "\n",
       "4. **DeepMind Solves Fluid Dynamics Singularity Problem**  \n",
       "   - In a breakthrough bridging generative AI and scientific research, **DeepMind** applied tailored AI models to unravel a century-old fluid dynamics problem: identifying previously unknown families of **unstable singularities**. This has wide implications for understanding turbulence, with benefits in engineering, meteorology, and medicine ([businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-deepmind-cracks-century-old-physics-mystery-ai-fluid-dynamics-2025-11?utm_source=openai)).\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Google’s Nano Banana 2 Leak – Next-Gen Image Generator**  \n",
       "   - A leak hints at Google developing **Nano Banana 2**, a potential upgrade to its image generation tools, offering **native 2K image generation**, **4K upscaling**, and a multi-step refinement process called **“Lightbox”** to enhance realism and visual coherence ([tomsguide.com](https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/ai-image-video/nano-banana-2-leak-reveals-googles-new-studio-lightbox-heres-what-we-know?utm_source=openai)).  \n",

       "\n",
       "2. **Teams**: Each team consists of five players on the court at a time.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Game Duration**: A standard game is divided into four quarters, each lasting 12 minutes in the NBA. Other leagues may have different durations.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Scoring**: Points are scored as follows:\n",
       "   - Field goals are worth two points, or three points if the shooter is behind the three-point line.\n",
       "   - Free throws are worth one point each.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Dribbling**: Players must dribble the ball (bounce it on the floor) while moving. If a player stops dribbling, they cannot start again until another player touches the ball.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Violations**: Common violations include traveling (taking too many steps without dribbling), double dribble (dribbling with both hands or starting to dribble again after stopping), and shot clock violations (failing to attempt a shot within the allotted time).\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Fouls**: Physical contact that impedes an opponent can result in a foul. Accumulating too many fouls can lead to free throws for the opposing team.\n",

       "8. **Possession**: The game starts with a jump ball, and possession alternates between teams after each quarter.\n",

       "9. **Defense**: Teams can play man-to-man or zone defense to prevent the opposing team from scoring.\n",
